Data, model and procedure, the only paradigm about software. 

I like to talk about philosophy, economy, statistics and inference, language and comunication, and anything related to informatics. 

I would like to break the capitalist system so I came here to build a decentralized company to empower software developers and tailor a new collaboration system based on blockchain technology.
