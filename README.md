Data, model and procedure, a paradigm about software. 

With a initial introduction to software development with artificial intelligence to analyze biological data, I became trapped by this amazing field and then became proficient in every possible subject about it. From low level programming for embedded systems (C), passing through management skills for project and company management, and also IT development following DevOps culture. 

In my repos you will be able to find projects from different kinds, which I uploaded to show my skillset, and also to develop some personal projects.
